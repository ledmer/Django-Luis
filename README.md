Cooking Stove webpage project!
The basic purpose of the website is to provide diagrams and pictures of the clean cooking system
that can be viewed and downloaded so that people in rural areas can build and install their own
system. They could then upload pictures of their system, and any changes they made to adapt it
to their local circumstances.
The website would include the following sections and features:

## Primary Designs
Primary designs and construction videos, classified by climate, roof type, use and geographic
location. Users would have the ability to search through the designs and installations to find
ones that fit their criteria.
## Post/blog
Users can post pictures and descriptions of their installations. Other visitors can make comments
on the posts
## Summary Statistics
Visitors would be able to see statistics on the number, type and location of installations
